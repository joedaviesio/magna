Two of the tenancies relate to a house in which the tenants have exclusive rights to occupy their respective sleeping quarters while sharing some facilities (that is, the premises would be a boarding house except that the premises are not occupied, or intended by the landlord to be occupied, by at least 6 tenants). Under subsection (2C), those 2 tenancies must be treated as 1 tenancy. As a result, A is treated as having 3 tenancies.A’s spouse, B, is also a landlord and has 4 tenancies. Under subsection (2B), because B is an associated person of A, A must be treated as if A were also the landlord of B’s 4 tenancies.
