The Part includes provisions that—(a) require every health practitioner to be registered for a scope of practice:(b) require applicants for registration—(i) to have the qualifications prescribed by the responsible authority for the applicant’s intended scope of practice; and(ii) to be competent to practise within that scope of practice; and(iii) to be fit for registration, which includes the ability to communicate effectively for the purposes of practising within that scope of practice:(c) stop a health practitioner from practising without a current practising certificate:(d) stop the authority, in the case of applications for practising certificates, from approving those applications unless the authority is satisfied that the health practitioners concerned are competent to practise in accordance with their scopes of practice.(3) Part 3 provides mechanisms for improving the competence of health practitioners and for protecting the public from health practitioners who practise below the required standard of competence or who are unable to perform the required functions. These mechanisms include competence reviews, competence programmes, recertification programmes, medical examinations, and protected quality assurance activities. The Part also contains provisions that—(a) allow health practitioners to notify the responsible authority if they have reason to believe that another health practitioner may pose a risk of harm to the public by practising below the required standard of competence:(b) enable the responsible authority to order the interim suspension of a health practitioner’s practising certificate if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the practitioner poses a risk of serious harm to the public by practising below the required standard of competence:(c) enable the responsible authority to order the suspension of a health practitioner if the authority is satisfied that the practitioner is unable to perform the functions required for the practice of his or her profession because of some mental or physical condition or if the practitioner has not complied with a requirement for a medical examination:(d) enable the Minister to confer protection on quality assurance activities conducted to improve the practices or competence of health practitioners and so protect the confidentiality of information that becomes known solely as a result of those activities and give those engaged in those activities immunity from civil liability.(4) Part 4 provides for the establishment by each authority of professional conduct committees to investigate complaints referred to the authority by the Health and Disability Commissioner.
