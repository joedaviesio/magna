Exclusions under Schedule 1 apply and accordingly the offers to these investors do not require disclosure under this Part.However, none of the exclusions in Schedule 1 apply to the remaining 60 investors.

These obligations apply to all of the investors even if the offers to some of those investors do not require disclosure. For example, all money paid for the shares must be held in trust under section 87 (even if the money is paid by a wholesale investor, a relative, or a close business associate), ongoing disclosure under subpart 4 may be required to be made to a wholesale investor, a relative, or a close business associate, and registers of financial products kept under subpart 4 of Part 4 relate to products held by all product holders.(2) In this Act, regulated product means—(a) a financial product offered under a regulated offer; or(b) a managed investment product in a registered scheme (whether or not there has been a regulated offer).",
