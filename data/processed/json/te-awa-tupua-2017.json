In particular, the Crown acknowledges that it promoted and implemented legislation during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries that had little or no recognition of Whanganui Iwi interests in the Whanganui River and that had no provision for the involvement of Whanganui Iwi in the management of the River, including—(a) the enactment of the Wanganui River Trust Act 1891 and its amendments, which empowered the Wanganui River Trust to erect jetties, clear the Whanganui River for navigation purposes, and control and sell river gravel and shingle; and(b) the enactment of the Coal-mines Act Amendment Act 1903, which deemed the beds of all navigable rivers to “have always been vested in the Crown” and that all minerals contained within those river beds belonged to the Crown; and(c) the acquisition of over 6 700 acres of riparian land owned by Whanganui Iwi along the Whanganui River under the Public Works Act 1908 for scenery preservation purposes.(8) The Crown acknowledges that it has failed to recognise, respect, and protect the special relationship of the iwi and hapū of Whanganui with the Whanganui River.(9) The Crown acknowledges that—(a) from the mid-1880s the Crown started to remove pā tuna and utu piharau and alter the Whanganui River to enable the passage of steam boats on the River; and(b) the removal of pā tuna and utu piharau adversely affected an important food source and valuable taonga of Whanganui Iwi; and(c) Whanganui Iwi opposed the actions of the Wanganui River Trust in relation to the clearance of the Whanganui River, including the destruction and damage of pā tuna and utu piharau, which led to the conviction of members of Whanganui Iwi who took steps to try to protect their taonga; and(d) River clearances contributed to a decline in the exercise of customary fishing practices by the iwi and hapū of Whanganui and an associated loss of mātauranga.(10) The Crown acknowledges that the Crown and other parties have extracted large amounts of gravel from the bed of the Whanganui River and that the effects of that extraction and the lack of compensation have been a source of grievance for Whanganui Iwi since the late nineteenth century.(11) The Crown acknowledges that by the middle of the twentieth century the cumulative effect of the Crown’s acts and omissions in relation to the Whanganui River had caused significant prejudice to Whanganui Iwi.(12) The Crown acknowledges that the cumulative effect of these acts and omissions amounted to a failure to ",
