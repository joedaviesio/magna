Instead of providing food catering services through its employees, it enters into an agreement with an independent contractor to provide those services.The agreement under which the independent contractor provides those services to the rest home expires or is terminated.The rest home then uses its employees or engages further employees to provide those services.Employees of the independent contractor to whom section 69F applies may elect to transfer to the rest home.Example BThe circumstances in this example are the same as in example A except that the independent contractor engages a subcontractor to provide food catering services to the rest home.As a result of the agreement between the rest home and the independent contractor expiring or being terminated, the agreement between the independent contractor and the subcontractor expires or is terminated.Employees of the subcontractor to whom section 69F applies may elect to transfer to the rest home.NoteIn both example A and example B, it does not matter whether the rest home’s or the independent contractor’s employees originally provided the food catering services or whether the work was contracted out or subcontracted at the outset.In example A and example B, the persons relate to the definition of contracting in as follows:the rest home is person A:the independent contractor is person B.(4) This subsection sets out examples of contracting out.Example CA school has employees who provide cleaning services.The school then enters into an agreement with an independent contractor to do that work or some of that work.The employees of the school to whom section 69F applies may elect to transfer to the independent contractor.NoteExample C would not be a contracting out if, at the outset, the school does not have employees providing cleaning services.In example C, the persons relate to the definition of contracting out as follows:the school is person A:the independent contractor is person B.Example DThe circumstances in this example are the same as in example C, except that later on the independent contractor decides that, instead of using its employees for the contract for the school, it will engage a subcontractor to do the work or some of the work.Employees of the independent contractor to whom section 69F applies may elect to transfer to the subcontractor.NoteIn example D, the persons relate to the definition of contracting out as follows:the independent contractor is person A:the subcontractor is person B.NoteIn example C and example D if, at the outset, the independent contractor did not have employees providing cleaning services, but subcontracts the work straight away, then the employees to whom section 69F applies may elect to transfer to the subcontractor.(5) This subsection sets out examples of subsequent contracting.Example EAn airport operator enters into an agreement with an independent contractor to provide food catering services at the airport.Some time later, the agreement under which the independent contractor provides those services expires or is terminated.The airport operator then enters into an agreement with a second independent contractor to provide food catering services at the airport.Employees of the first independent contractor to whom section 69F applies may elect to transfer to the second independent contractor.NoteIn example E, it does not matter whether the agreement between the airport operator and the first independent contractor constitutes a contracting out.In example E, the persons relate to the definition of subsequent contracting as follows:the airport operator is person A:the first independent contractor is person B:the second independent contractor is person C.Example FThe circumstances in this example are the same as in example E, except that the first independent contractor engages a subcontractor to do the work or some of the work.Later on, the agreement under which the subcontractor provides the work expires or is terminated and the first independent contractor engages a second subcontractor to provide food catering services at the airport.The employees of the first subcontractor to whom section 69F applies may elect to transfer to the second subcontractor.NoteIn example F, the subsequent contracting occurs at the subcontracting level.In example F, the persons relate to the definition of subsequent contracting as follows:the independent contractor is person A:the first subcontractor is person B:the second subcontractor is person C.",

A retailer owns 3 gift shops and engages an independent contractor to clean the shops. The independent contractor employs a cleaner to clean the gift shops.The cleaning contract between the retailer and the independent contractor expires.The retailer enters into a cleaning contract with a second independent contractor for the cleaning of 1 shop, and enters into a new cleaning contract with the first independent contractor for the cleaning of the other 2 shops.As a result, the first independent contractor no longer requires the cleaner to clean 1 of the shops.The cleaner may elect to transfer and become an employee of the second independent contractor in relation to 1 shop while remaining an employee of the first independent contractor in relation to the other 2 shops.",
