Both sections include a class of decisions in respect of non-regulatory activities of the unitary authority within a local board area. The governing body must allocate responsibility for decisions within this class to either itself or the local board for the area, in accordance with the principles in section 48L(2). The results of the allocation must then be set out in the long-term plan and the annual plans of the unitary authority so that people of each local board area, and any other persons, can easily determine whether the governing body or a local board is responsible for any particular decision of the unitary authority.",
