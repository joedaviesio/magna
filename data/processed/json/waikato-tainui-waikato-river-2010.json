When the Governor’s intentions to put an iron steamer on the River became known late in 1862, Patara Te Tuhi, editor of the Kiingitanga newspaper Te Hokioi, expressed the opposition of the chiefs warning that the gunboat might not enter the River without permission. He asserted tribal authority over the River in these words: “E hara a Waikato awa i a te kuini, erangi no nga Maori anake”.
