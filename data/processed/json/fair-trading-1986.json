The contract includes a transparent term under which A is to pay B $253,000 ($220,000 plus GST) for services to be provided before 1 December 2023. On 1 November 2023, A and B enter into a contract on substantially similar terms. The second contract includes a transparent term for A to pay B $57,500 ($50,000 plus GST) for services to be provided in 2024.Neither contract is a small trade contract because the annual value threshold of $250,000 is exceeded when the trading relationship first arises.Example 2C and D are both engaged in trade. They enter into 2 contracts for C to buy fruit from D. The contracts are on the same terms except that the first contract relates to grapes and is entered into on 1 January 2023, and the second contract relates to apples and is entered into a year later, on 1 January 2024. Neither contract is a consumer contract and there are no other contracts in the trading relationship.The parties’ expectation when entering into the first contract is that C will spend approximately $120,000 per year under it and that from 2024 it will also spend $180,000 per year under the second contract.Neither contract is a small trade contract because, despite the different subject matter, they form part of the same trading relationship and the annual value threshold of $250,000 is exceeded when the trading relationship first arises.Example 3On 1 May 2024, E and F, who are both engaged in trade, enter into an open-ended contract for E to supply stationery to F. The contract is not a consumer contract and the trading relationship contains no other contracts.The contract does not include transparent terms setting out the consideration to be paid, but based on their previous interactions the parties expect that F will spend $100,000 under it each year. However, after several years F is purchasing significantly more stationery than originally anticipated. E is now supplying $300,000 worth of stationery to F each year. There has been no variation of the contract.The contract starts as and remains a small trade contract because the annual value threshold of $250,000 is not exceeded when the trading relationship first arises.",
