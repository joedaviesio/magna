      "text": "(16) The relationship between Maniapoto and the Waipa River is historic, intellectual, physical, and spiritual and is expressed by the people of Maniapoto in various ways— The awa was a playground, a place to fish for inanga and for tuna, for freshwater crayfish, watercress, taraute and parera. During World War II and rationing, the awa was the source of kai. Significant tuna pa structures could be seen if the river level dropped during a dry spell. The 1958 flood changed that.(b) The Waipa is a sacred river where the tohi rituals were performed, where the umbilical rites were observed and where the purification rituals were undertaken.(c) The river chants its farewells to our departed ones, its murmuring waters bid welcome to our newborn and to our illustrious visitors from afar.(d) Like an atua I wing my way into the heavens above! I gaze down below! There below lies my river Waipa, cutting her way over the breast of my native land. My eyes brim with tears at the vision of splendour, ’tis the love for my river that meanders away. My eyes gaze intently upon the deep pools of the river they are the myriad lairs of Waiwaia; the atua who gathers food for the people. The rocks of the river are an easy pillow for my head. The deep stretches of the river are a bed that rejuvenates my spirit and body. I am sustained by the river, by taking the waters of the ancients, drawing the waters from the atua, by procuring the very water of life!(e) The rippling waters are clearly heard by my ears. Within the rippling I hear the murmurs of the past, of days gone, of times long ago! Thus the heart is prompted to proclaim, “The river is an institution of tradition, an institution of knowledge, a festal board of treasured wisdom!”.(f) Waipa she is the life blood of the people. Waipa she is the life blood of the land, verily she is! Indeed she is the unfailing spring of the earth! She is the water that anoints the thymos of man to bind to the tribe the waters of life that issues forth from the lineage of the atua. She is the water that blesses the umbilical cord to ensure the health of the descendants of Maniapoto. ’Tis the water that permanently renders the knot of the navel cord secure and fast.(g) The source of my river is at the foot of Rangitoto, it is Te Pekepeke! Let her flow on she is the Kauhanga-nui (the Great passage) the Kauhanga-roa (the Long passage)! The waters ploughed by the paddles of the many flotillas of Maniapoto of times passed. Let her flow northwards to where the currents do mingle within the Waikato there before the countenance of my King.(h) Flow on oh waters to the north and to the west! Go out from Te Puaha to Tangaroa who lies broken upon the shore, and to the courtyard of Hine-kirikiri. Go on! Go on depart for distant place far away!(i) Describing the likeness of Waiwaia... as having an amazing appearance... the ripples of the water reflecting in the sun under the moonlight... Rainbows that appear in the waterfall.... But the most important part of Waiwaia is that it is the water itself and without it man could not survive.",
