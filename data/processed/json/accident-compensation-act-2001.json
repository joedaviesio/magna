For the purposes of this example, these are assumed to be 3.25%, 3.35%, 3.35%, 3.38%, 3.31%, and 3.31%, being the published rates for the months from October 2017 to March 2018. The average of these 6 observations is 3.325%.The base rate plus the premium, namely 0.95% in this case, is 4.275%. This is the interest rate that must be used for the remaining 138 days of the liability period.The total interest payable may be calculated using the equation—I = P(r1t1 + r2t2)where—I is the total interest payableP is the amount of the interest that should have been paidr1 is the interest rate for the 46 days of the liability period up to 30 June 2018t1 is the portion of the liability period up to 30 June 2018 expressed in yearsr2 is the interest rate for the 138 days of the liability period starting on 1 July 2018t2 is the portion of the liability period starting on 1 July 2018 expressed in yearsI = 100(0.04175 x 46/365 + 0.04275 x 138/365) = 2.1425I = $2.14",
