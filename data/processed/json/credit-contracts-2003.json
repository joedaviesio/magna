and(ii) before entering into an agreement to provide credit or finance or a relevant insurance contract and before taking a relevant guarantee; and(iii) in all subsequent dealings with a borrower in relation to an agreement or a relevant insurance contract or a guarantor in relation to a relevant guarantee; and(b) comply with all the lender responsibilities specified in subsections (3), (4), and (5).(3) The lender responsibilities are that a lender must, in relation to an agreement with a borrower,—(a) make reasonable inquiries, before entering into the agreement, and before making a material change referred to in subsection (8), so as to be satisfied that it is likely that—(i) the credit or finance provided under the agreement will meet the borrower’s requirements and objectives; and(ii) the borrower will make the payments under the agreement without suffering substantial hardship; and(b) assist the borrower to reach an informed decision as to whether or not to enter into the agreement and to be reasonably aware of the full implications of entering into the agreement, including by ensuring that—(i) any advertising—(A) complies with the advertising standards set out in the regulations; and(B) is not, or is not likely to be, misleading, deceptive, or confusing to borrowers; and(ii) the terms of the agreement are expressed in plain language in a clear, concise, and intelligible manner; and(iii) any information provided by the lender to the borrower is not presented in a manner that is, or is likely to be, misleading, deceptive, or confusing; and(iv) reasonable steps are taken to offer to the borrower information about the agreement in another language (language A) if—(A) advertising that is wholly or significantly in language A is being, or within the preceding 6 months has been, distributed to the public or a section of the public; and (B) the steps are necessary to ensure that the borrower can reach an informed decision (for example, if the borrower may not have a good understanding of the language in which the lender is otherwise providing information to the borrower under this Act); and(c) assist the borrower to reach informed decisions in all subsequent dealings in relation to the agreement, including by ensuring that—(i) any variation to the agreement is expressed in plain language in a clear, concise, and intelligible manner; and(ii) any information provided by the lender to the borrower after the agreement has been entered into is not presented in a manner that is, or is likely to be, misleading, deceptive, or confusing;

The maximum costs of borrowing that Ms D will have to pay under that contract and any contract that replaces that contract is $100.On 2 March, Ms D has paid $92, consisting of $32 in interest and fees and $60 of the principal. Her unpaid balance is $40.Ms D refinances by entering into a further high-cost consumer credit contract with C to repay the remaining $40, and will receive a further advance of $50, ie, $90 in total. The first advance of $100 caps the maximum costs of borrowing. The maximum costs of borrowing that Ms D will have to pay under the new contract is $100 - $32 = $68 (ie, the amount in interest and fees charged on the first contract ($32) is subtracted from the first advance of $100 to give a remaining cap of $68).C is not entitled to receive more than $68. If Ms D does pay $120 (instead of $68), C must refund $52 to Ms D, or give Ms D a credit for $52 against other money owing (see section 48).In addition, C is liable in other ways, for example, to a pecuniary penalty, statutory damages, and other court orders.",
