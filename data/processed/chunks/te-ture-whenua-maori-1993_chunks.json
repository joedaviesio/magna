shares in the incorporation, to be allocated among the new shareholders, proportionately to their former share of the value of the land and other assets passing to the incorporation.(5) Subject to subsection (6), the additional number of shares shall be fixed by the court and shall bear the same relation to the total shares of the incorporation immediately before the amending order as the value
