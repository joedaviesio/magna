levy for transitional period\n\n(1) The Minister must, before the commencement of the 2017/18 financial year, estimate the amount of FENZ’s net costs for the 2017/18 financial year.(2) For the purposes of subclause (1), FENZ’s net costs for the 2017/18 financial year are—(a) its estimated direct and indirect costs of performing functions and duties and exercising powers under this Act or any other enactment that will arise in the 2017/18 financial year; less(b) any estimated income that FENZ will receive in the 2017/18 financial year from any source other than the levy.(3) The Minister must then determine the portion of FENZ’s net costs for the 2017/18 financial year that must be met by levy.(4) The Minister must then recommend the making of regulations under clause 27 to recover, in the 2017/18 financial year, the portion of FENZ’s net costs for the 2017/18 financial year that the Minister has determined are to be met by levies.(5) If the transitional period continues beyond the close of 30 June 2018 (because sections 80 to 140 commence later than 1 July 2018), the levy rate or rates prescribed in regulations made under clause 27 in accordance with a recommendation made under subclause (4) continue to apply until the end of the transitional period.(6) However, the Minister may, at any time during the transitional period, recommend the amendment of the regulations if the Minister is satisfied that—(a) actual net costs in the transitional period are likely to vary significantly from the estimate of net costs under subclause (2) on which the regulations were based (after that estimate has been adjusted to reflect the expected length of the transitional period); and(b) the persons likely to be substantially affected by the amendment, or their representatives, have been consulted.", "metadata": {"act_title": "Fire and Emergency New Zealand Act 2017", "act_short_name": "FENZ", "act_year": 2017, "act_url":
