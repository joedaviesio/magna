of putting them into a deliverable state, the property does not pass until such thing is done, and the buyer has notice thereof.Rule 3Where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods in a deliverable state, but the seller is bound to weigh, measure, test, or do some other act or thing with reference to the goods for the purpose of ascertaining the price, the property does not pass until such act or thing is done, and the buyer has notice thereof.Rule 4Where goods are delivered to the buyer on approval, or on sale or return or other similar terms, the property therein passes to
