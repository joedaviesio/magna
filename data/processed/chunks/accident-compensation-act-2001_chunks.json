affect the Work Account levies payable by levy payers who are not participating in the programme; and(iii) the expected administration costs of the programme; and(iv) the impact of the programme on the administration of the accident compensation scheme as a whole and on claims management processes; and(b) endeavour to ensure that programmes are available for a variety of types of employers and
