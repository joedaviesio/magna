and(e) define certain terms used in this Act.(3) This Act generally applies only to express trusts, but there are some exceptions (see section 5(1) and (2)). An express trust is one that is intentionally established by a settlor, as opposed to a trust that arises by operation of law (as listed in section 5(2)﻿(b)) or the order of a court. Express trusts(4) Part 2 contains fundamental provisions about express trusts. An express trust is a relationship in which a settlor places property on trust to be held by 1 or more trustees for the benefit of beneficiaries or a permitted purpose. As a fiduciary, each trustee owes duties and is accountable for how the trust property is managed and distributed (see sections 12 to 15).(5) Part 2 includes provisions that—(a) set out the characteristics of an express trust; and(b) specify how an express trust may be created; and(c) specify the maximum duration of most express trusts (which is 125 years) and abolish the rule against perpetuities; and(d) specify the age of majority for the purposes of an express trust (which is 18).Trustees’ duties and information obligations(6) Part 3 relates to the duties and information obligations that are part of the role of trustee.", "metadata": {"act_title": "Trusts Act 2019", "act_short_name": "TA", "act_year": 2019, "act_url": "https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2019/0038/latest/whole.html", "topics": ["trust", "trustee", "beneficiary", "settlement", "fiduciary"], "section_number": "6", "section_heading": "6 Overview of this Act", "section_level": "section", "section_part": "", "section_url": "https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2019/0038/latest/DLM7382824", "chunk_index": 0, "total_chunks": 3, "token_count": 380}}, {"id": "fc4534f047c4", "text": "In particular, it contains provisions that—(a) set out the mandatory duties that apply to trustees of all express trusts; and(b) set out the default duties that apply to trustees of a trust unless the terms of the trust modify or exclude those duties; and(c) restrict the use of trustee exemption clauses and trustee indemnity clauses (which limit the degree to which trustees can be held accountable for certain misconduct) in the terms of a trust; and(d) set out the documents that must be kept by trustees and the information that trustees must give to beneficiaries (and that aim to ensure that beneficiaries have sufficient information to enable the terms of the trust to be enforced against the trustees).Trustees’ powers and indemnities(7) Part 4 relates to the powers trustees have in their role and sets out the indemnities that apply to trustees.
